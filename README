This is a set of tools we use for dealing with simulation results that come out
of marss. 

I sincerely apologize for the code you're about to witness it was written in an
evolutionary style so it's not particularly clean or elegant, but some of it
might be useful for people to look at to design their own helper scripts.

I'll eventually try to write up some stuff about what there are intended to do
...

The graphing scripts rely heavily on numpy and matplotlib, which are excellent
math and plotting libraries, respectively. 

0. Prerequisites 
To use the graphing scripts, you'll need matplotlib and numpy. On ubuntu, these
are in packages: python-matplotlib python-numpy

To use mstats.py, you'll need the yaml bindings for python. On ubuntu, these are
in package: python-yaml

For the lazy: 
$ sudo apt-get install python-yaml python-matplotlib python-numpy


1. Emailer Scripts

1.1 XOauth
=================================================================================
The two gmail scripts here use a token-based authentication system which
doesn't require a password. This means that you don't have to put your gmail
password in plaintext on your hard drive and the tokens can be revoked via your
gmail account in case someone gets access to them. For more details, see:
http://code.google.com/apis/gmail/oauth/ 

While your key is disposable and won't let someone change your password, it
will allow someone to send and receive email from your account, so please don't
go accidentally submitting your file to a git repo or in a patch or something. 

If you do, however, make sure to revoke this key in your google account
settings.


To use the scripts, you're going to need to use the xoauth.py file (which is
google's sample script, not mine) to generate an xoauth.txt file.

First, run: $ ./xoauth.py --generate_oauth_token --user=YOUR_USERNAME@gmail.com

This will give you a URL to go to which will either use your logged in account
or will ask you to login. After you enter in your verification code, the xoauth
script will generate an xoauth.txt file for you. 

1.2 Testing out the passwordless gmail
================================================================================
Adjust the paths in your util.cfg so that they match your actual system (use
util.cfg.example as a starting point).

After you have an xoauth.txt and the correct paths in util.cfg, you can test
to see that everything went fine by running 

$ ./send_gmail.py 

This will use your xoauth information to send an email to whatever address you
have specified in your util.cfg file as the destination address from the
account for which you have a token (these can be the same account). 

If you receieve the email successfully, then the xoauth is working. 

1.3 Polling gmail
================================================================================
After the xoauth is working, you can also use the poll_gmail.py script which
will login to gmail, get the unread messages from a specific label, and send
back a simulation status report. 

For now the simulation status report is generated in sim_status.py and this
file tends to be sort of specific to what I name my disk images/screen
sessions/etc. So, please change it to suit your own simulation setup.

Running: 

$ ./poll_gmail.py 

Should either report that there are no messages in the target gmail lable, or
send a simulation status string to the email address given in your util.cfg.

This should be scheduled as a cron job. To keep cron from sending you the
output to your mailbox, I've included a wrapper script called poll_gmail.sh
which kills the output of the script. So you should adjust the path to your
utils folder in this file and run: 


crontab -e

An editor will come up with the cron file; add the line: 

*/3 * * * * $HOME/marss.utils/poll_gmail.sh

(change the 3 to the polling frequency in minutes).

2. Graphing Scripts
================================================================================
2.1 Requirements 

The graphing scripts can generate line plots using matplotlib and numpy. Currently,
a png output format (raster) and LaTeX output format (vector PDF) are supported. 

The LaTeX output mode is convenient for producing vector graphs that can be imported
into LaTeX and used directly with pdflatex. 

The graphing scripts are based on the python libraries matplotlib and numpy.
You'll need to obtain these libraries either through your distribution's
package manager or some other means. 

If you're on ubuntu, you can use apt-get: 

$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-matplotlib

For the LaTeX output mode, you'll also need: texlive-extra-utils texlive-latex-extra packages. 


2.2 Data Format
Currently, the default format that can be read by the scripts is a CSV file
with header information such as: 

cycle_number,bandwidth,latency
1000,5.4,122
2000,5.1,132
3000,5.2,130

This format is consistent with the output format of the new time-based stats 
support in marss. For more information about how to use the new time-based stats 
please my post here: http://www.mail-archive.com/marss86-devel@cs.binghamton.edu/msg00433.html

2.3 Specifying Graphs
There are four main objects in Graphs.py: CompositeGraph, SingleGraph, LinePlot, and DataTable.

A DataTable is essentially a numpy representation of a CSV file. 

A LinePlot is a single line on a graph. The data source is a DataTable and an x column
and y column of the DataTable. The columns can either be indexed by name or by number. 

A SingleGraph is made up of one more more LinePlots, a title, and axes labels.

A CompositeGraph is made up of multiple SingleGraphs that are laid out and saved to 
a file. 

2.4 Adding Derived Columns
Sometimes purely graphing stats is not very useful and one would like to graph a 
function of two or more variables (for example: 
average latency = total latency / number of requests). The function add_derived_column
allows for this type of functionality. It supports a function that takes an arbitrary
number of parameters and an array of column indices (name or index). 

So for example: 

def percent(a,b):
	return float(b)/float(a)*100.0
dt = DataTable("foo.csv");
dt.add_derived_column(percent, [1,2], "foo_percent");

This will take columns 1 and 2 and call the function 'percent' on each pair of
values in these columns. The data will go into the data table with the column
name titled "foo_percent" which can be referenced when creating a LinePlot
object. See the main function in Graphs.py for an example. 

2.5 Examples
For now, please see the bottom of Graphs.py for examples of how to generate
graphs.
